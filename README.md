# Pegasus_Seq2Seq_Model
PEGASUS uses an encoder-decoder model for sequence-to-sequence learning. In such a model, the encoder will first take into consideration the context of the whole input text and encode the input text into something called context vector, which is basically a numerical representation of the input text.
